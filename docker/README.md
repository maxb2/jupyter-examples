# Docker with JupyterLab 3 Extensions

This repository contains a Docker based demo of `JupyterLab` running on `Jupyter Server`:

- JupyterLab is now a [Jupyter Server extension](https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developers/extensions.html).
- [NbClassic](https://github.com/Zsailer/nbclassic) provides a shim for configuration and generates warning for deprecated NotebookApp configuration usage and ensures backwards compatibility of existings notebook server extensions.

JupyterLab is built from source and we add the following extensions:

- jupyterlab extension example https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-examples/blob/3.0/advanced/server-extension/README.md
- jupyterlab git https://github.com/jupyter/nbdime/pull/551 + https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git/pull/818
- jupyterlab voila https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila/pull/732

## Build the Docker Image

```bash
# Use it with Docker.
make build
```

Some details when building the docker image (you can see the [`@jupyterlab-examples/server-extension` notebook extension being activated and usable](https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-examples/blob/master/advanced/server-extension/README.md)).
